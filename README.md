# üí° LDR Sensor

The project goal was to characterise the response of an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) under various lighting conditions and creating an enclosure for protecting the materials.


## ‚ö°Ô∏è Calculated Volt 

Volt = Vs √ó Rldr / (R1 + Rldr) 

-	Vs = 6V (supply voltage),
-	R1 = 5.1kŒ© (fixed resistor),
-	Rldr = resistance of the LDR

The voltage was measured under 4 different lighting conditions:

1.	Darkness: LDR covered.
2.	Ambient: Base room brightness.
3.  Bright: Flashlight with low intensity directed at the LDR.
5.  Radiant: Flashlight with high intensity directed at the LDR.

## üé® Design 

The design criteria for the enclosure focused on the protecting of the materials while embracing creativity to explore different forms with 3D printing.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Final Project

The program developed for the microprocessor implements a system that monitors light levels with the current date and logs the data/time to a SD card while displaying the brightness level on an OLED display.
