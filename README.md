# üí° LDR Sensor

The project goal was to characterise the response of an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) under various lighting conditions, enabling us to understand how its resistance changes with light intensity and creating an enclosure for protecting the materials.


## ‚ö°Ô∏è Calculated Volt 

Volt = Vs √ó RLDR / (R1+RLDR) 

-	Vs = 6V (supply voltage),
-	R1 = 5.1kŒ© (fixed resistor),
-	RLDR = resistance of the LDR, which varies with light intensity.

The voltage was measured under 4 different lighting conditions:

1.	Ambient lighting: Base room brightness.
2.	Darkness: LDR covered with a piece of paper.
3.  Bright light: Flashlight with low intensity directed at the LDR.
4.  Radiant light: Flashlight with high intensity directed at the LDR.

## üé® Design 

### TinkerCAD 3D Design 

The design criteria for the enclosure focused on the protecting of the materials while embracing creativity to explore different forms with 3D printing.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Final Project

The program developed for the microprocessor implements a system that monitors light levels with the current date and logs the data/time to a SD card while displaying the brightness level on an OLED display.
